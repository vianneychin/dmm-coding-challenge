## 🍕 My Tech Stack Choices
<ul>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
   <li>Express/Node</li>
   <li>nanoid</li>
</ul>
<p>I used JavaScript and Node because that's what I am most familiar with. I am a stronger JavaScript developer than I am a PHP developer. I would have loved to do it in PHP/Laravel is I was able to get my development enviroment for it setup quickly, but I ran into too many problems with getting it to migrate with mySQL.</p>
